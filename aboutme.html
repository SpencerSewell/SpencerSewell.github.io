									<h2>Who am I?</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									I was born and raised in the sunny state of Florida but made the move to Georgia during my freshman year of high school. It was during these 
									years that my deep-seated passion for mathematics began to blossom. While I initially found myself immersed 
									in the world of music as a member of the highschool's band and proudly serving as the percussion section leader, my interests gradually 
									shifted. What was once a interest in music performance transformed into an head-strong commitment to mathematics, and eventually, the realm of 
									data science.
								</p>
								<p>
									My working journey began during highschool in the fast-food industry at Arby's, steadily climbing the ranks to become a shift leader. 
									During this time, I enrolled at the University of North Georgia, majoring in mathematics with a minor in statistics. 
									During my time there, I didn't just limit myself to the classroom. I actively engaged in extracurricular activities, including membership 
									in the chess club, percussion ensemble, Night Hawks Drumline, concert band, and serving as the vice president of the mathematics club. In 2023, I proudly donned my graduation cap, and soon after, 
									I entered a new chapter in life by getting married and welcoming a beautiful daughter into the world. My career path also took a new turn 
									as I transitioned into the healthcare field, where I currently serve as a unit assistant in the Emergency Room of a prominent hospital. 
									As I look ahead, my desire is to start exploring the captivating world of data analytics and harness its potential to drive meaningful 
									insights and innovations.
